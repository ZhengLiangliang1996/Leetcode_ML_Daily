        One of the solution use dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] be a maximum amount of fuel we can have, when we reached station number i and refueled j times before this station (not included). Let us also add two more points to our stops: starting one and ending one. Then, how we can update dp[i][j]: we can

Either refuel on previous station, than we have dp[i-1][j-1] minus distance we covered between i-1 and i stations and plus amount of fuel we get at last station.
Or it can be dp[i-1][j] plus distance we covered between i-1 and i stations.
If we have cand < 0 in our code, than it means we can not reach position i with j refuels, so we leave it equal to minus infinity. Finally, in the end we check last station and find the smallest index where value is not negative and return it.
